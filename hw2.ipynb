        "We used three optimizers: one for the autoencoder, generators and discriminator. This was because this enabled us to accurately think about which loss we were actually calculating and what we were trying to optimize. For the autoencoder, we calculate the loss as the difference between the generators ouputs and the real images. For the generator, we calculate the loss as the reconstructed images that the discriminator was able to predict as fake. We detached the gradients from the encoder to ensure only the generator was trained. For the discriminator we did the same but we also calculated the loss as the real images that the discriminator was not able to tell as real. For the reconstructed images, we detached them from the generator inorder to only train the discriminator.\n",

        "\n",
        "Look back at the slides, notebook, and/or readings around mode collapse in GANs.\n",
        "* First, give a one or two sentence definition of what mode collapse is, in your own words.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mode collapse is a phenomenon where a GAN produces limited variations of output samples, failing to capture the full diversity of the training data. Basically, there is a combination of features that seem to fool the discriminator and the model gets “too comfortable” in learning those features that it just settles to the mode of the distribution and ends up spitting out non-varied outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Second, explain why mode collapse is *more* or *less* likely in the above model that incorporates an autoencoder into the GAN. Write at least two sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "I think incorporating an autoencoder into a GAN may make mode collapse more likely to occur. This is because the autoencoder compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation, which can lessen the input data variety. This way we could have multiple points in a higher dimensional space getting mapped to fewer points in a lower dimensional space which may not capture all the important features of the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Loss functions (3 points)\n",
        "\n",
        "In the above model that you trained, there are different loss functions for the autoencoder, generator, and discriminator. For each pair of losses, describe whether and how the two losses are in conflict. That is, when training your model, does reducing loss #1 tend to increase loss #2? Why or why not?\n",
        "\n",
        "* a. Generator loss and discriminator loss\n",
        "\n",
        "The two losses are in conflict. Because the discriminator tries to maximize the loss while the generator tries to minimize the loss, If the discriminator loss is high and the generator loss is low, then the generator is doing a successful job at fooling the discriminator. So reducing the generator loss tends to increase the discriminator loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "* b. Generator loss and autoencoder loss\n",
        "\n",
        "The two losses go together. Because the autoencoder is being fed into the discriminator, if it has a high loss (doing a poor job at compressing the data), this would affect the decompressed data that the generator spits out which may end up doing a poor job at fooling the discriminator, and in that way, increase the generator loss. So reducing the generator loss tends to reduce the autoencoder loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "* c. Discriminator loss and autoencoder loss\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the autoencoder works alongside the generator, if it has a high loss, it’ll affect how bad the generator loss would be, which would, in turn, make it worse at fooling the discriminator and in that case make the discriminator loss go low. So reducing the discriminator loss tends to increase the autoencoder loss.\n",

        "Suppose you wanted to add in class-conditioning to [the generator and discriminator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1784.pdf) and [the autoencoder](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2015/file/8d55a249e6baa5c06772297520da2051-Paper.pdf) in your model. How and why would this change your loss function(s)?\n",

        "Incorporating class conditioning would involve adding additional terms that encourage the generator and the autoencoder to generate output data that belongs to the specified class. This way, the loss functions could be “hardcoded” to perform better, and thus make them lower."
